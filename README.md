= Siglet = Sigma.js + Leaflet.js =

An incomplete start on using the leaflet.js rendering to display a map as well as network data from Sigma.js

A working example of the opposite approach (using Sigma.js as the main renderer) has [already been done](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js/tree/develop/plugins/sigma.plugins.leaflet).

Depends on and many thanks to the following libraries included in this repository:
* [Leaflet.js](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet)
* [Sigma.js](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js)
* [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
